* Finish upgrading to Clojure 1.3 by type hinting functions so boxing doesn't happen.
* Break out protocols and caller functions (e.g. e-map) from implementaions.
* Flesh out API more with additional use cases.
* Add wrappers for decompositions.
* Add native code wrappers.
* Investigate UJMP to see if its API is flexible and powerful enough to avoid having to wrap other libraries ourselves.
* Investigate ways to provide metadata on the matrices for column naming and other uses.
* Documentation. :)
